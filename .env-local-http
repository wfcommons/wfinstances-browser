### CERTIFICATE AND KEY FOR HTTPS
# On a production server, to use https, you need to create a certificate. Here is an example using certbot from Let's Encrypt:
#   % apt instal certbot
#   % sudo certbot certonly --standalone
#       ...
#     Successfully received certificate.
#     Certificate is saved at: /etc/letsencrypt/live/dirt02.ics.hawaii.edu/fullchain.pem
#     Key is saved at:         /etc/letsencrypt/live/dirt02.ics.hawaii.edu/privkey.pem
#     This certificate expires on 2024-11-02.
#     These files will be updated when the certificate renews.
#     Certbot has set up a scheduled task to automatically renew this certificate in the background.
#
# For local testing: openssl req -x509 -nodes -days 365 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem
