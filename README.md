## About WFInstances Browser
WFInstances Browser is a stand-alone web application that allows its users to access and browse all of the available Workflow Instances within the open-source WFCommons Project.
The table was developed to reduce the labor-intensive traversal of the multiple Github Repositories that make up the WFCommons project as well as explicitly display useful information to allow users to find instances that fit their specific projects.

As such, the current implementation of the WFInstances Browser allows the user to view all of the different Workflow Instances and sort them based on the metrics of:
- Workflow ID
- Github Repository
- Number of Tasks
- Number of Files
- Total Bytes Read (MB)
- Total Bytes Written (MB)
- Total Work (min)
- Depth of Workflow
- Minimum Width
- Maximum Width

Users are able to filter and search within the above metrics to easily find and download the Workflow Instance(s) that fit their respective needs.

You are able to find out more information on the WFCommons Project [here](https://wfcommons.org).

## Quickstart Installation

#### Docker
Using Docker, run the following command to launch the UI, API, and database altogether:
```
docker compose up
```
Once Docker is finished building and starting the containers, you are able to view and use the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You can also view the API documentation at
[http://localhost:8081/docs](http://localhost:8081/docs).

#### Populating the database
Note that the database is empty the first time you launch the application which means the table displayed at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) will be empty. Populate the database with WfInstances and their metrics from the offical WfCommon GitHub repos by running the following commands in a terminal:
```
curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/wf-instances/github/wfcommons/nextflow-instances

curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/wf-instances/github/wfcommons/makeflow-instance

curl -X POST http://localhost:8081/wf-instances/github/wfcommons/pegasus-instances
```

## Manual Installation

#### Mongo Database Setup:
Setup your own MongoDB and provide the MONGO_URI in a .env file. The .env file should be placed in the /api folder. For example:

`/api/.env`
```
MONGO_URI=THE_URI_TO_YOUR_MONGODB
```
 A database named `wf_instance_browser_db` will be automatically generated upon launching the API.

---

#### Python API Backend:
WfInstances Browser requires the usage of Python 3.11 or higher.
You can download the latest versions of Python [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

In the api directory, initialize the backend by running the following in a terminal:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
And then run the backend using:
```
uvicorn src.main:app --port 8081
```

If you would like to view the API documentation following the deployment, you can visit:
[http://localhost:8081/docs](http://localhost:8081/docs).

#### Remix UI Frontend:
WfInstances Browser requires the LTS version of Node.js.
You can download the latest versions of Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/en).

In the ui directory, initialize the application by running the following in a terminal:
```
npm install
```
Following this, you can build the application using:
```
npm run build
```
And then run the application using:
```
npm run start
```
You are able to view and use the application at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

#### Filtering Instances:
Besides searching for instances, you are able to filter Workflow instances upon many different categories.
Below is an example of sorting the "Number of Files" column between the values of 200 and 300.
